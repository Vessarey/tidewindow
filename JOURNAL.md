## 2026-07-02 — Launch

**Done:** Full launch build. NOAA pipeline (12 stations: 3 WA, 4 OR, 4 CA, 1 ME;
hourly interpolation for harmonic stations, cosine for Pillar Point; scores per
/methodology/), 4 tools (finder, trip picker, year heatmap, golden hour), 20
fact-checked launch articles, monthly calendar pages for 2026-07 and 2026-08
(staged programmatic rollout, batch 1 = 24 pages), king-tides 2026-27 page,
Daylight Minus-Tide Index dataset + CSV, ICS feeds per station, embed badges,
llms.txt, RSS, sitemap, JSON-LD (WebSite, Dataset, Article, FAQPage, Breadcrumb,
WebApplication), IndexNow key + submit script, daily data-refresh GitHub Action
(10:17 UTC), deploy-on-push GitHub Action.

**Deliberate choices:** GitHub Pages over Vercel (only authenticated channel;
static export; migration path documented). PostHog wired but env-gated — no key
yet; signups meanwhile land in localStorage + are no-ops in analytics. Newsletter
copy says "starting this season" because sending isn't wired (no Resend key) —
honesty invariant.

**Metrics:** n/a (analytics not yet enabled; expect months 0–3 near-zero organic
per strategy brief — do NOT panic-pivot).

**Tomorrow:** verify deploy + IndexNow green (BACKLOG P0), then start P1 content
queue with the weekly regional roundup.
